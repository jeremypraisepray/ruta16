# Mariscos Ruta 16 y Más — "Parada Nocturna"

Static marketing site for Mariscos Ruta 16 y Más (Sinaloa-style seafood — 2726 Spencer Hwy,
Pasadena, TX 77504). Built from the design handoff bundle; the current spec lives in
`design/handoff-2026-08/` (menu v2 — 8 paradas, dish and drink cut-outs).

**Stack:** Next.js 15 (App Router) + React 19, no backend, no data fetching.
`next.config.mjs` sets `output: 'export'`, so `npm run build` emits a fully static `out/`
directory that Vercel (or any static host) serves as-is.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:3000
npm run build    # static export → out/
```

## Pages

| Route        | Source                  | Notes |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | ----- |
| `/`          | `app/page.js`           | Video hero, parada rail, top sellers, *Platos de la Ruta*, *La Barra* marquee, specials, patio, reviews |
| `/menu`      | `app/menu/page.js`      | Interactive — client-side parada filter, per-parada art and *Plato destacado* |
| `/nosotros`  | `app/nosotros/page.js`  | Video hero, story, pillars, *Lo que sale del pase*, postales grid |
| `/visitanos` | `app/visitanos/page.js` | Address / contact / horario, specials, *Pide pa' llevar*, service areas |

## Menu data

`data/menu.json` is the content source of truth: 8 paradas, 29 groups, 112 items with prices and
descriptions, matching printed menu v2 (Topo Chico is $4 per the owner, not the $3 the PDF prints).
It was extracted programmatically from the logic class of `Ruta16 Menu.dc.html` so nothing was lost
in transcription. `components/MenuBoard.js` renders it and owns the single piece of state on the
site — `active: 'all' | '01'…'08'`. Changing the filter calls
`window.scrollTo({ top: 0 })` (never `scrollIntoView`), and the "ON THE ROAD AHEAD" button advances
the filter to the next parada.

Shared facts (hours, socials, service areas, specials, order/maps URLs) live in `data/site.js`.

## Design system

Tokens are CSS custom properties at the top of `app/globals.css`:

- Navy `#141722` · deep panel `#0e1119` · nav `rgba(20,23,34,.93)` + `backdrop-filter: blur(8px)`
- Red `#e2493b` · blue `#2f6fb5` · light blue `#2f8fd5` · hairline `rgba(255,255,255,.08)`
- Barlow Condensed 500–800 (headings, nav, prices, labels) and Barlow 400–700 (body), loaded with
  `next/font/google` so the woff2 files are self-hosted in the build — no runtime request to Google.

Signature motifs are implemented as reusable classes: `.barSplit` (6px red/blue split bar),
`.ring` (dashed-ring circles, alternating red/blue), `.dotLeader` (dotted leader lines),
`.hero__ghost` / `.parada__ghost` (giant ghost numerals), `.hero__dots` (dot-grid overlay),
`.hero__rail` (vertical rail text).

## Assets

All assets are self-hosted under `public/`.

- **Photos** — the ten `.webp` files from the bundle, copied and renamed by subject
  (`torre-mariscos`, `molcajete-aguachile`, `ostiones-r16`, …).
- **Videos** — the two phone-quality source videos re-encoded for web with ffmpeg:
  scaled to 720×1280, audio stripped (they play muted), H.264 CRF 28, `+faststart`.
  `hero-home.mp4` 8.0 MB → **2.0 MB**; `hero-nosotros.mp4` 5.4 MB → **1.3 MB**.
  Each ships a `-poster.webp` still, and the `<video>` elements are
  `autoplay muted loop playsinline preload="metadata"` with the poster as the first paint.
  (VP9/WebM variants were encoded and discarded — both came out larger than the H.264 files.)
- **Dish & drink cut-outs** — the transparent PNGs from the `assets-v2` and `assets-v3` releases,
  resized to the largest box the design renders them in (×2 for retina) and converted to alpha WebP:
  49.9 MB → 3.0 MB for the first 26, 39.4 MB → 2.2 MB for the 19 that followed. 45 in the library;
  the ones not currently placed are staged for slots that need new copy first. `components/Cutout.js` renders them; `data/cutouts.json` carries each file's
  intrinsic size so lazy loading reserves the right box, and the component releases whichever axis
  the CSS does not constrain so the aspect ratio is never squashed.
- **Logo** — `public/brand/ruta16-logo.png`, the official artwork extracted from the client's
  `LOGO_RUTA_16` PDF (a 406×587 raster with an alpha mask, lifted off the PDF's white page so it sits
  transparent on the navy nav). `public/brand/ruta16-icon.png` is the same mark on a navy square,
  used as the favicon and Apple touch icon. `components/BrandLogo.js` is the only place it is used.

## Known deviations from the handoff

One thing differs from the bundle, deliberately:

1. **Top-seller circles are 3px shorter per row than the design reference.** In the reference the
   photos are inline images, so each ring picks up ~3px of line-box descender space below the photo.
   This build sets `img { display: block }`, which removes it. Everything else on Home matches the
   reference to the pixel; the cumulative page-height difference is 6px across the two rows.

The handoff's logo URL (`ruta16.com/pluto-images/brand-logos/…`) was unreachable from this build
environment, so the mark comes from the client-supplied `LOGO_RUTA_16` PDF instead. It renders at the
58px height the design specifies; since the artwork is portrait (405×587), that works out to 40px
wide in the nav.

Every other measured box — position, size, font size, weight, letter-spacing and color — matches the
rendered design references exactly at 1440px. Menú, Nosotros and Visítanos match to a document height
of 0px difference, and every cut-out renders at the reference's size (two portrait drinks differ by
1px from rounding in the WebP resize).

Three bits of copy in the v2 references still described the 7-parada menu. They were corrected at
the client's request, so these three strings intentionally differ from the design reference:

- Home, above *Platos de la Ruta*: "SIETE PARADAS · UN SOLO VIAJE" → "OCHO PARADAS · UN SOLO VIAJE".
- Home, above *La Barra*: "PARADA 07 · ÚLTIMA PARADA" → "PARADA 08 · ÚLTIMA PARADA" (Cheves, whose
  section tag in the menu data is likewise "ÚLTIMA PARADA").
- Nosotros, second story paragraph: "siete paradas" → "ocho paradas".

## Responsive

Below ~1100px is not designed; `app/globals.css` implements the stacking rules from the handoff:
nav collapses to a hamburger drawer, hero headline drops to 56px (44px under 640px), the parada rail
scrolls horizontally, top sellers go 2-col (1-col under 640px), specials stack, 2-col layouts stack,
menu groups go 1-col, postales go 2-col. No horizontal overflow at 320–1440px.

Two further rules earn their place on phones:

- **Menu rows wrap.** In one narrow column a long name plus a multi-price string ("6 pc $13 · 12 pc
  $17 · 16 pc $21") made the row wider than its section, and `overflow: hidden` (there for the ghost
  numerals) cut the price off. Below 1100px the row wraps: the price drops to its own line,
  right-aligned, and keeps the leader dots.
- **Hero cut-outs stay.** Rather than hiding them, the three hero cut-outs move above the copy —
  into what is otherwise dead video space — capped in size so they never reach the headline. The
  eyebrows drop to 15px/3px tracking there so the 8px desktop tracking does not orphan a word.
